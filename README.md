# 2wheel-self-balancing_bot-using_PID
This Project demonstrates the application of PID implementation for balancing a two wheeled bot.

The code is written and compiled on mbed platform.
The microcontroller used is LPC1768 and MPU6050 is used as a IMU to obtain real time inclination of the bot.
The error correction is done using a proportional, integral and differential controller.

The code can be modified further as per indivisual needs.
